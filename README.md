Mirage - AI-Powered Digital Twin for Conversations
🚀 A Django-based AI platform that creates a lifelike digital twin of users, replicating their personality and voice for realistic conversations.

📌 Project Overview
Mirage allows users to create AI-powered digital twins by cloning their voice and personality. The system generates responses based on stored personality traits and simulates conversations in a natural way.

✨ Features
👤 User Management: Sign-up, login, and profile creation.

🗣️ AI Personality Cloning: Users input traits, and Mirage models their personality.

🎙️ Voice Cloning: Upload and process voice samples for AI-based voice replication.

💬 Realistic Chat Simulation: AI-powered responses mimic the user's conversational style.

🔄 Chat History: Stores conversations for users to review and analyze.

🌍 REST API: Provides endpoints for seamless integration with frontend apps.
